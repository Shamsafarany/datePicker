# datePicker
https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui
you are required to create a simple datepicker UI using only HTML and CSS. It will not be a functional datepicker, but a static UI component that you can later enhance with JavaScript.
The goal of this project is to help you practice positioning, layout, and styling techniques in CSS
